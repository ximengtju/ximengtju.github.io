# 👩‍🎓 About Me
I am an assistant researcher at the [School of Electrical Automation and Information Engineering](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/), Tianjin University (天津大学电气自动化与信息工程学院), China, and a member of the [Artificial Intelligence and Marine Information Processing Laboratory](http://aimip.tju.edu.cn/) (人工智能与海洋信息处理实验室). Prior to this, I earned my B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Tianjin University, under the supervision of [Prof. Jiachen Yang](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1386/4830.htm) (杨嘉琛).

My current research interests include **Marine Information Processing**, **Intelligent Underwater Unmanned Systems**, **Reinforcement Learning**, and **Embodied Intelligence**. I have published over 20 papers in top-tier international journals, including IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TII, IEEE TITS, and IEEE TASE. I hold several academic positions, including Member of IEEE BTS and Workshop Chair for RoSeN 2026.

📢📢 <span style="color:red;">Our group is seeking research assistants to work on multiple projects related to **Autonomous Underwater Vehicle**, **Embodied Intelligence**, etc. Drop me an email if you are interested.
