# 👩‍🎓 About Me
I am an assistant researcher at the [School of Electrical Automation and Information Engineering](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/), Tianjin University (天津大学电气自动化与信息工程学院), China, and a member of the [Artificial Intelligence and Marine Information Processing Laboratory](http://aimip.tju.edu.cn/) (人工智能与海洋信息处理实验室). Prior to this, I earned both my B.E. and Ph.D. degrees from Tianjin University, China, under the supervision of [Prof. Jiachen Yang](https://seea.tju.edu.cn/info/1386/4830.htm) (杨嘉琛).

My current research interests include **Post-quantum Cryptography Chip** and **Fully Homomorphic Encryption**. I have published over 20 papers at the top-tier international conferences and journals, including ACM IMWUT, IEEE TMC, IEEE TWC, IEEE TAP, etc. I hold several academic positions such as TPC Member of TrustCom 2025 and Workshop Chair of ICA3PP 2023.

📢📢 <span style="color:red;">Our group is seeking research assistants to work on multiple projects related to **Cryptographic Hardware Acceleration**, **FHE Applications**, etc. Drop me an email if you are interested.
